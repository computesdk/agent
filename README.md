# ComputeSDK's Agent
A terminal based agent that works with any LLM (heavily inspired by Claude Code)

## What is Agent?
Agent is a terminal-based agent that works with any LLM. It is designed to be a simple and easy-to-use tool for interacting with LLMs. Agent is built using React and Ink, and is designed to be used in a terminal environment.

## Features
- **Simple and Easy-to-Use**: Agent is designed to be a simple and easy-to-use tool for interacting with LLMs.
- **Built Using React and Ink**: Agent is built using React and Ink, and is designed to be used in a terminal environment.
- **Works with Any LLM**: Agent works with any LLM, making it a versatile tool for interacting with LLMs.

## Why the terminal as an interface?
In the early days of computing, terminal-based interfaces were the primary tool for developers and engineers. The terminal was the first interface built for developersâ€”IDEs came later. The reason for this enduring relevance is that the terminal provides a simple, direct interface for interaction.

At Compute, we believe the terminal will be the primary interface for AI agents. In the age of AI, the terminal remains the most versatile tool for interacting with LLMs, making it perfectly suited for developers' workflows and the next generation of AI-powered development.
